# PATHFINDING ALGORITHM

The problem to be solved is a maze. Ben is in the upper left corner of the room. The point he wants to get to is the bottom right corner of the room. Your task is to determine the path that Ben must take to reach the end point. Note that Ben cannot go through forbidden places, such as walls - let's call them collisions. The chosen path does not have to be the optimal one, but the solution must be complete - if there is any way Ben can get from A to B, you should be able to return this path. If there are no possible solutions, you should display an appropriate message about the lack of possible paths to the goal.

The tool can be visualized using the CLI or a browser.

You cannot use ready-made npm packages or use ready-made scripts that will implement the algorithm for you.

Good luck!
